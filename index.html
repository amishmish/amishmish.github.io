                <p> Welcome to my website! I am Amishi Mishra, a first year student at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, majoring in Mathematics. I am from Apex, NC, but 
                    I was born in India, and lived there till I was five years old, switching schools nine times by the time I started high school. In my free time, I love to create, whether that is through
                    drawing, crocheting, or painting.
